        your memories. We do not listen to or record conversations in the background.</p>

    <h3>1.4 Sharing Controls</h3>
    <p>You have the control to allow or prevent your friends from sharing your pins and journeys. This preference can be
        managed in the Privacy section of the Settings menu.</p>

    <h3>1.5 Image Analysis & Content Moderation</h3>

        <li>Offensive symbols</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Images flagged as violating our <a href="terms-of-service.html">Terms of Service</a> are strictly rejected and
        deleted immediately. We do not retain rejected content.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide and maintain the App's core functionality (mapping, memory creation).</li>
        <li>To personalize your experience by showing relevant content based on your location.</li>
        <li>To improve our services and develop new features.</li>
    </ul>
